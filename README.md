Encryption Component
====================

The Encryption Component is an opinionated, high level abstraction over encryption
libraries and PHP's Sodium extension. Encryption should be understandable without
an degree in Cryptography.

**This Component is experimental**.
[Experimental features](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/experimental.html)
are not covered by Symfony's
[Backward Compatibility Promise](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/bc.html).
